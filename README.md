# COVID-19 Data Scraping and Analysis

### **COVID-19 Data Scraping and Analysis**

### **Overview**
This script scrapes COVID-19 data from [Worldometer's Coronavirus page](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) and saves it into a CSV file named "covid19_now_2024_23_03.csv". It then performs data analysis and cleaning using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup, requests, and pandas. The cleaned data is stored in a pandas DataFrame with updated column names for better readability and understanding.
